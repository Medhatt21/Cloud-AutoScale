Business Requirement Document (BRD) – Project Stages

Stage 1: Baseline Implementation (AWS/Azure-style Scheduling & Autoscaling)
- Objective: Replicate rule-based workload placement, autoscaling, and container scheduling similar to AWS EC2 Auto Scaling and Azure VMSS.
- Requirements:
  * Threshold-based scaling (CPU, memory, request load).
  * Scheduled scaling (time-based policies).
  * Simple workload placement (spread, compact, fault-domain aware).
  * Container scheduling policies similar to Kubernetes (affinity, taints/tolerations).
- Expected Outcome: A simulator capable of running baseline scheduling with reactive and predictive scaling.

Stage 2: ML/DL-based Scheduling
- Objective: Use ML/DL to forecast workload demand and improve autoscaling & placement.
- Requirements:
  * Time-series forecasting (LSTM/Temporal CNN, ARIMA, Prophet) for predictive scaling.
  * Supervised model for placement classification (which node/VM type to choose).
  * Integration of ML models into the simulator for decision-making.
- Expected Outcome: Reduced SLA violations and improved efficiency vs baseline.

Stage 3: Reinforcement Learning Scheduling
- Objective: Use RL for adaptive scheduling & scaling.
- Requirements:
  * Define state, action, reward environment for RL (Gym-based).
  * Train PPO/DQN agent to optimize SLA compliance, cost, and energy.
  * Compare performance against baselines.
- Expected Outcome: RL agent learns policies that outperform static and ML-based methods in dynamic workloads.

Stage 4: Evaluation & Comparison
- Objective: Compare all approaches quantitatively.
- Requirements:
  * Metrics: SLA violation rate, latency, scaling efficiency, energy/cost savings.
  * Run experiments across Google, Azure, and Alibaba traces.
  * Stress tests: bursty traffic, node failures, heterogeneous resource scenarios.
- Expected Outcome: Comprehensive analysis showing trade-offs between rule-based, ML, and RL scheduling.
