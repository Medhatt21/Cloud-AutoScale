Project Task List

1. Project Setup
- Create Git repository & project structure.
- Setup Docker environment with Python + dependencies.

2. Data Preparation
- Download and preprocess Google Cluster Traces 2019.
- Preprocess Azure Public Dataset V2 (2019).
- Optional: prepare Alibaba 2018 dataset.
- Generate clean CSV/Parquet for workloads.

3. Simulator Development (Baseline)
- Build SimPy simulator with hosts, VMs, containers, workloads.
- Implement placement policies: spread, compact, affinity/anti-affinity.
- Implement baseline autoscaling: threshold-based, scheduled, predictive.

4. ML/DL Scheduling
- Develop workload forecasting models (LSTM/ARIMA/Prophet).
- Train supervised placement classifier.
- Integrate ML-based decisions into simulator.

5. RL Scheduling
- Define Gym environment for autoscaling + placement.
- Implement reward structure (SLA, cost, churn penalties).
- Train PPO/DQN agent with Stable-Baselines3.
- Run experiments with multiple seeds.

6. Evaluation & Comparison
- Define metrics: SLA violations, latency, scaling actions, cost proxy, energy proxy.
- Run experiments on baseline vs ML vs RL.
- Conduct stress tests (bursty traffic, node failures).

7. Documentation & Reporting
- Prepare experiment results & plots.
- Write report: methodology, results, discussion.
- Prepare final presentation & demo notebook.

8. Weekly Meetings
- Monday: planning meeting (1h).
- Thursday: progress sync (30m).
- Daily async updates (Sun–Thu).
